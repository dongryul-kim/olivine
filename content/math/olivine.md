Ian Gleason defines the olivine spectrum, which is some sort of enhancement of
the adic spectrum. [His thesis](https://ianandreigf.github.io/Website/tesis.pdf)

## Definition

A point in the adic spectrum is by definition a multiplicative valuation on the
ring. A point in the olivine spectrum is supposed to be a pair of two
valuations $(v^h, v^a)$ where
- $v^a$ is rank-$1$,
- $v^a$ is a vertical generalization of $v^h$.

Warning: a trivial valuation is also regarded as a rank-$1$ valuation.

By definition, there are continuous maps $$ \operatorname{Spo}(R, R^+) \to
\operatorname{Spa}(R, R^+) \to \operatorname{Spec} R. $$
